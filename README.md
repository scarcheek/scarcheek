### Griaß enk! 👋
I'm some dude who gets the urge to develop a new kinda-useless application whenever I feel the need to! I just finished the HTL Villach, a secondary high school focused on software engineering, and am now looking forward to doing my civil service for Red Cross.

### Apart from programming I do 👍
🎮 I like playing competetive as well as super chill games so hmu if you wanna play sometime.<br>
🚴‍♀️ I go for bike trips every once in a while!<br>
🚑 I'm a passionate paramedic and tend to sometimes save lifes... but most of the time its just driving old people around

### Currently working on 🤠
Most of the time when I do private projects I work together with my buddy [Lancear](https://github.com/Lancear)!
This includes, but is not limited to these projects we ¿kinda? still work on:

🛏️ [An app which helps you manage a polyphasic sleep schedule](https://github.com/scarcheek/SleepScheduler)<br>
📻 [A Discord Rich Presence tool to share your currently-listened-to youtube song](https://github.com/scarcheek/DiscordRadio)<br>

*Yoinked the layout from [Lancear](https://github.com/Lancear). Tell him I said hi 😊*
