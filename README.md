### Griaß enk! 🐱‍💻
I'm some dude who gets the urge to develop a new kinda-useless application whenever I feel the need to! I just finished the HTL Villach, a secondary high school focused on software engineering, and am now looking forward to doing my civil service for Red Cross.

### Apart from programming I like 🥳
🎮 I enjoy getting an adrenaline rush from ADHD drenched games like ULTRAKILL or DOOM<br>
🚴‍♀️ I go for bike trips every once in a while... So that's a thing!<br>
